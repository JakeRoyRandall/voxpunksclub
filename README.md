I volunteered to build a responsive website for a small NFT community: Vox Punks Club.

This project was fun because I learned how to display 3D models in the browser using google model-viewer. The website also allows users to see the NFTs in Augmented Reality (AR) on Mobile.

Otherwise, this is a straightforward, though well-designed, website built using react.
